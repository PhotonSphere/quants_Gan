# 📘 Week 1 – Day 1: Capital Markets and Market Microstructure

## 🌍 Capital Markets Overview

**Capital markets** are the venues where savings and investments are channeled between suppliers (investors) and users (companies, governments) of capital.  
They play a central role in the global economy by facilitating **fundraising, risk transfer, and wealth creation**.  

Capital markets are typically divided into two main segments:

### 1. Primary Markets
- Where new securities are issued and sold for the first time.  
- Companies/governments raise funds directly from investors.  
- Examples: Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), bond issuance.  

### 2. Secondary Markets
- Where existing securities are traded between investors.  
- Provide **liquidity** and **price discovery**.  
- Examples: NSE, BSE, NYSE, NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange, bond trading platforms.

## 🏦 Key Components of Capital Markets

- **Equity Markets:** Investors buy ownership stakes in companies (stocks).  
- **Debt Markets:** Governments and corporations issue bonds/notes to borrow funds.  
- **Derivatives Markets:** Contracts whose value derives from underlying assets (options, futures, swaps).  
- **Foreign Exchange (FX):** Global currency trading, critical for international trade and finance.

## 📊 Functions of Capital Markets

1. **Capital Allocation:** Efficiently channel funds from savers to borrowers.  
2. **Price Discovery:** Securities prices reflect supply, demand, and available information.  
3. **Liquidity Provision:** Allow investors to enter/exit positions easily.  
4. **Risk Transfer & Management:** Through derivatives and hedging strategies.  
5. **Economic Growth:** Enable businesses and governments to finance expansion and projects.

## 📑 Why Capital Markets Matter
- For **investors:** Provide opportunities for growth, income, and diversification.  
- For **issuers (firms & governments):** Provide access to funding at scale.  
- For the **economy:** Enable innovation, job creation, and infrastructure development.

## 🔗 Transition to Market Microstructure
While **capital markets** explain the *big picture* — the roles, participants, and instruments —  
**market microstructure** zooms in on the **mechanics of trading**:  
- How are buy/sell orders matched?  
- What determines the spread between bid and ask?  
- How does information flow affect price formation?  

This transition allows us to move from **macro-level capital markets** into the **micro-level mechanics** that drive day-to-day trading activity.

## 📖 Introduction
**Market microstructure** is a field of finance that studies the processes and rules that govern how financial assets are traded.  
- Traditional finance: Focuses on what assets are worth.  
- Market microstructure: Focuses on *how* that value is determined through the mechanics of trading.  

It examines details of a market’s design and how these details affect **prices, transaction costs, volume, and participant behavior**.

## 🔑 Key Components of Market Microstructure

### 1. Trading Mechanisms
Rules and systems used to match buyers and sellers:
- **Quote-Driven Markets (Dealer Markets):** Dealers/market makers post bid/ask prices and stand ready to trade (e.g., OTC market).  
- **Order-Driven Markets:** Orders collected in a central order book, executed by price–time priority (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ).  
- **Hybrid Markets:** Combine both, using market makers alongside order books.  

### 2. Order Types
Common trader instructions:  
- **Market Orders:** Execute immediately at best available price.  
- **Limit Orders:** Buy/sell at a specified price or better.  
- **Stop Orders:** Triggered when a specific price is reached.  

### 3. Price Formation & Discovery
Process by which collective actions of market participants determine prices.  
- Influenced by **information asymmetry, trading costs, and order flow**.  

### 4. Liquidity & Volatility
- **Liquidity:** Ease of trading without large price impact.  
- **Volatility:** Rate of price fluctuation.  
- Key concepts:  
  - **Bid-Ask Spread** → Difference between buyer’s bid & seller’s ask.  
  - **Market Depth** → Quantity available at various price levels.

## 💡 Importance of Market Microstructure
Understanding microstructure is crucial in the era of electronic and algorithmic trading. It helps participants:  
- **Optimize trading strategies** (HFT & algorithmic strategies).  
- **Manage transaction costs** (explicit: commissions/fees; implicit: price impact).  
- **Analyze market behavior** (price movements, information flow, participant roles).  

---

## 🎓 Advanced Market Microstructure

At an advanced level, market microstructure models how **rules, participant behavior, and information flow** affect asset prices in real-time.  
It has evolved significantly with **electronic and high-frequency trading (HFT)**.

### 📐 Key Models & Theories

#### 1. Inventory Models
- Example: **Amihud & Mendelson (1980)**.  
- Focus: Market makers manage inventory risk.  
- Trade-off:  
  - Narrow spreads → attract volume.  
  - Wider spreads → compensate for inventory risk.  
- Explains why spreads vary with **order flow volatility** and **inventory imbalances**.  

#### 2. Information-Based Models
- **Glosten–Milgrom (1985):**  
  - Three trader types: informed, uninformed (liquidity), and market maker.  
  - Market makers widen spreads to protect against informed traders.  
  - Prices update as trades reveal information.  

- **Kyle (1985):**  
  - One informed trader breaks orders to minimize price impact.  
  - Market maker adjusts prices based on total order flow.  
  - Introduces **lambda (λ):** measures price impact of trades (market depth).  

---

### ⚡ High-Frequency Trading (HFT) & Microstructure

#### Strategies
- **Market Making:** Capture bid-ask spread by posting simultaneous buy/sell orders.  
- **Arbitrage:** Exploit small price discrepancies (e.g., stock vs. futures).  
- **Liquidity Detection:** Probe markets with small "ping" orders to find hidden liquidity.  

#### Market Impact
- **Pros:**  
  - Narrower spreads → cheaper trading.  
  - Faster price discovery → new info incorporated instantly.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Can add instability (e.g., **quote stuffing**, excessive cancellations).  
  - Linked to **flash crashes** due to rapid cascades of algorithmic trades.
