# 7-Day Research Work
_Exploring Market Microstructure, Asset Classes, Corporate Finance, and Multi-Asset Analysis_

---

## Day 1: Market Microstructure – Theory Meets Practice

Market microstructure bridges theory and practice, showing how market rules and participant behavior drive **price formation, liquidity, and volatility**.  

At the advanced level, it provides a framework for understanding:  

- High-Frequency Trading (HFT)  
- Trading costs  
- Information asymmetry in modern markets  

---

## Day 2: Market Microstructure – Deep Dive

Market microstructure is:  

- 📘 **A theoretical framework** (models of information, inventory, and execution).  
- 📊 **A mathematical playground** (stochastic calculus, optimization, queueing, control theory).  
- 🧪 **An empirical lab** (LOB data, metrics, machine learning).  
- ⚔️ **A strategic battlefield** (HFT, arbitrage, execution, risk management).  

👉 It is the **intersection of math, data, and speed**, where trading strategies are forged in the split seconds that define modern financial markets.

## Day 3: Asset Classes Overview

**Definition:**  
An asset class is a group of investments that share similar characteristics and behavior in the marketplace.  

**Purpose:**  
Grouping assets enables **diversification**, since different asset classes respond differently under various economic conditions.  

### Market Context

- **Equities**: IPOs (primary), stock exchanges (secondary).  
- **Bonds**: Yield ↔ price inverse relation.  
- **Derivatives**: Futures & options (India: Nifty/Bank Nifty).  
- **ETFs**: Diversified, low-cost, liquid.  
- **FX**: Largest market, currency pairs.  
- **Commodities**: Driven by supply/demand, geopolitical risks.  
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Decentralized, volatile, correlated with risk assets.

## Day 4: Corporate Finance – DCF & Cost of Capital

Corporate finance focuses on how companies manage:  

- Funding sources  
- Capital structure  
- Investment decisions  
- Allocation of financial resources  

**Two cornerstone concepts:**  

1. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis**  
2. **Cost of Capital (WACC)**  

---

## Day 5: Python Implementation – WACC Calculation

Implementation notebook: **Cost of Equity, Cost of Debt, and WACC**  

This script uses the **yfinance** library to fetch live data for Reliance and the Indian market, then applies formulas for the Cost of Equity, Cost of Debt, and WACC.  

### 📈 Sample Results & Interpretation

- **Risk-Free Rate**: Current yield on 10-year Indian Government Bond (e.g., 7.00%)  
- **Beta**: Reliance’s volatility relative to Nifty 50 (e.g., 1.11)  
- **Market Return**: Annualized return of Nifty 50 over 5 years (e.g., 12.00%)

## Day 6: Analysis Report – Multi-Asset Normalized Price Trends (2018–2025)

### 🔎 Overview  
Objective: Interpret two visualizations of correlations and trend dynamics across selected assets.  

**Assets analyzed:**  
- Nifty 50, Nifty Bank, BSE Sensex  
- Nifty IT, Nifty Pharma  
- USD/INR, Gold, Crude Oil, Bitcoin  

**Time frame:** 2018–2025 (base value = 100).  

### Visuals Reviewed  
1. 📈 **Correlation heatmap** – monthly returns.  
2. 📉 **Interactive line chart** – normalized trends.  

### Key Interpretations  
- Correlation heatmap highlights diversification vs. concentration risks.  
- Line chart shows performance trajectories, volatility bursts, leadership shifts among assets.

## Day 7: Weekly Review & Wrap-Up  

### Summary of Outputs  
- **Day 1–2**: Foundations and advanced view of market microstructure.  
- **Day 3**: Asset class overview and diversification principles.  
- **Day 4–5**: Corporate finance focus with Python-based WACC implementation.
