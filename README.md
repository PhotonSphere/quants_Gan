# üìà Quant Skills Refresher & Portfolio Builder

Welcome to the **Quant Skills Refresher**, a **12-week intensive pathway** designed to sharpen your **financial, quantitative, and technical skills**.  

This repository contains all the **code, projects, and outputs** generated throughout the program, serving both as a **portfolio of work** and a **record of my learning journey**.  

The goal is to progress from **fundamental concepts** to **advanced applications**, with a strong emphasis on **practical implementation in Python**. Each module concludes with **portfolio-ready outputs**, including code notebooks, case studies, and presentations.
